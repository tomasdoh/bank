# Bank ðŸ’µ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomasdoh/bank.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomasdoh/bank) [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/tomasdoh/bank?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)
A command line application that models a bank account. The user can deposit, withdraw, and print statements.

## Approach

My main focus during this tech test was to focus on object-oriented design and clean code. I decided to use Node.js and to test-drive with Jasmine so that I could strengthen my knowledge of both.

## Testing

To view the tests locally, run `npm test` in the terminal.
